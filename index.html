          <p>In New Zealand's rugged Fiordland a bird thought extinct for fifty years is struggling for survival. Behind the rare species in its fight for life is all the protective power of the Dominion Government.</p>

          <p>Rediscovery of this flightless bird, the large, brilliant-hued native rail which the Maoris called <i>takahea</i>, meaning &ldquo;wandering at large,&rdquo; excited almost as much interest in New Zealand as discovery of a living passenger pigeon would arouse
            in America.</p>
          <div class="two-column">
            <p>To zoologists and bird lovers throughout the world, reappearance of takahea, now called the takahe, was a notable event. They had a scientific name for the creature–<i>Notornis hochstetteri</i>, the first half of which means "bird of the south"–but
            they knew tantalizingly little about it and had considered it lost in the limbo of vanished species.</p>
            <p>To the rediscoverer, <i>Dr. G. B. Orbell</i>, a physician of Invercargill, New Zealand, the dramatic sight of a takahe alive came as the reward of years of patient and systematic search. Only four of the birds were known to science when he made his discovery
            on the shore of a lake in what is now called Notornis Valley. Since August, 1898, there had been no authentic report of one being caught, or even seen.</p>

            <h1>Futile Wings Have Three-Foot Span</h1>
          </header>

          <p>A primitive type of large moor hen found only in New Zealand, the takahe is unlike any other member of the world-wide rail family to which it belongs. For example, despite its membership in an aquatic family, it avoids swamps and rivers. It does,
            however, share some of the clan's characteristics, such as a large frontal shield.</p>

          <p>The full-grown takahe stands some twenty inches high and weighs about six pounds. The wings, though incapable of flight, may have a three-foot span.</p>

          <p>The adult bird is vividly colored. Head, neck, breast, and flanks are an iridescent indigo blue, becoming brighter on the shoulders and changing to a malachite green on the mantle. The dark rump and upper tail coverts are olive green, the abdomen
            and thighs purplish black, and the under tail coverts white. The powerful beak is scarlet at the base, fading outwards to a wax pink. Legs and feet are red, eyes reddish brown.</p>

          <img src="images/takahe-bird.png" alt="Takahe" />

          <p>This brilliant color scheme is seen to full advantage only when the bird is approaching the observer or passing at right angles to him.</p>

          <p>In contrast to its showy parents, the young takahe wears only a uniform, soft black down. The black beak is white-tipped, and the disproportionately large legs are a pale purple.</p>

          <p>In New Zealand's ornithological history, extinction, or near extinction, has been the lot of many species as a result of settlement.</p>

        <blockquote>&ldquo;It originally occurred throughout forest and grass ecosystems. Today it is restricted to alpine tussock grasslands on the mainland and feeds primarily on juices from the bases of snow tussock and a species of fern rhizome. It eats introduced
          grasses on the islands. It usually lays two eggs and chicks can begin breeding at the end of their first year, but usually start in their second. It is long-lived, probably 14-20 years.&rdquo;

          <p>Originally, native birds had no enemies, and the vegetation which affords them cover was not subject to browsing by animals. Under these favorable conditions many unusual forms of life, including birds of little or no power of flight, were able

            <h1>Vanished Birds Include 12-Foot Moa</h1>
          </header>

          <p>Before the arrival of <i>Capt. James Cook</i> in 1769, birds were the dominant land vertebrates. The only land mammals were the dog, a Polynesian rat, and two species of bats. The dog and rat had been introduced by the Maoris on their second migration,
            about A. D. 1150. *</p>

          <p>After the Maoris had caused the extinction of the huge flightless moa, one species of which was twelve feet high, European settlement brought about more extensive changes. Ferrets, stoats, and weasels were introduced to control a plague of rabbits,
            and these, with cats, dogs, and other predators, virtually sealed the fate of numerous native species, among them the takahe.</p>

          <p>The first living takahe known to Europeans was purposely killed and eaten. It was caught by a sealing gang on Resolution Island, near the southwest end of South Island , in 1849. Two years later a party of Maoris caught a second bird in Thompson
            Sound, about forty miles farther north.</p>

          <p>Luckily, the skins of both birds were obtained by <i>Mr. W. D. B. Mantell</i>, who in 1847 had discovered the semi fossil remains of the North Island variety (duly named <i>Notornis mantelli</i> by <i>Sir Richard Owen</i>, of London). The skins were sent to the British
            Museum.
          </p>

          <p>Twenty-eight years passed before another specimen appeared. A rabbiter's dog caught it near the south end of Lake Te Anau. The bird was destined for the cooking pot when it was rescued by a farm manager and eventually sold to a museum in Dresden,
            Germany, for £105.</p>

        <div class="center-wrap">
          <p>After close examination, <i>Dr. Adolph B. Meyer</i> of the Dresden museum found that this bird was sufficiently different from the North Island semi fossil form found by Mantell to warrant a distinct name. Accordingly, the name <i>Notornis hochstetteri</i>
            was given the present species.</p>

          <p>The fourth specimen was caught by a dog on the shore of Middle Fiord of Lake Te Anau in 1898. The bird was bought by the Government for £250 to ensure that it remained in New Zealand. Preserved in the Otago Museum at Dunedin, it still is the only
            mounted specimen in the country, for no more takahe were known until Dr. Orbell's discovery.</p>

          <p>Notornis Valley, in South Island's Murchison Mountains, lies only six miles from a main road; yet it hid the takahe from human sight for decades. From boyhood Dr. G. B. Orbell, an Invercargill physician, reiused to believe the creature lost. After
            thirty years his quest succeeded; Dr. Orbell tracked the takahe to the scene of its last stand in one of the wildest parts of the Dominion.</p>
